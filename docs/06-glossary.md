# Glossary

## V8 & JIT Compilation Terms

### Bailout
When V8 decides it cannot optimize a function due to specific language features (e.g., `eval`, complex `try-catch`, `with`). The function continues to run in the interpreter.

### Bytecode
Intermediate representation generated by V8's parser. Executed by the Ignition interpreter before optimization.

### Deoptimization (Deopt)
When V8 discards optimized machine code and falls back to interpreted bytecode because speculative assumptions were violated. Can be **eager** (immediate) or **lazy** (deferred).

### Elements Kind
V8's internal classification of array storage types. Examples:
- `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`: Dense array of small integers
- `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`: Dense array of floats
- `PACKED_ELEMENTS`: Dense array of mixed types
- `HOLEY_*`: Sparse arrays with holes
- Transitions are **one-way** and **permanent**

### Feedback Vector
Data structure V8 uses to track type information observed during execution. Feeds into optimization decisions.

### Hidden Class (Shape/Map)
V8's internal representation of object structure. Objects with the same properties in the same order share a hidden class. Property access is optimized based on these classes.
- **Shape**: Common term in optimization literature
- **Map**: V8-specific internal term

### Ignition
V8's interpreter. Executes bytecode directly, collects type feedback for later optimization. Low startup overhead, decent throughput.

### Sparkplug
V8's baseline compiler. Converts Ignition bytecode to native machine code quickly using the collected feedback. Sparkplug is the default tier Node hits after a function runs a handful of times. Supports on-stack replacement (OSR) so loops can stay hot while upgrading tiers.

### Inline Cache (IC)
Caching mechanism for property access and function calls. Remembers the types seen at a particular call site.
- **States**: Uninitialized → Monomorphic → Polymorphic → Megamorphic
- **Transitions**: Generally one-way (can't go back from megamorphic)

### On-Stack Replacement (OSR)
Technique V8 uses to swap tiers inside a running function. Lets Sparkplug/Maglev drop into a long-running loop without restarting execution. Also used when deoptimizing back to a lower tier.

### Inlining
Optimization where the compiler replaces a function call with the function's body. Eliminates call overhead and enables further optimizations.

### Maglev
V8's mid-tier optimizing compiler (introduced ~2022). Much faster to compile than TurboFan while still performing specialization, shape checks, and some inlining. Often needs `--maglev` (or `--stress-maglev`) on current Node releases. Supports OSR up to TurboFan and can be limited via `--max-opt=2` for experiments.

### Megamorphic
IC state when a call site has seen 5+ different types. V8 gives up on type-specific optimization. **Silent killer** of performance.

### Monomorphic
IC state when a call site has seen exactly one type. Fastest case—V8 generates specialized code with no type checks.

### Polymorphic
IC state when a call site has seen 2-4 different types. V8 generates code with checks and branches. Still reasonably fast.

### Smi (Small Integer)
V8's tagged integer representation. 31-bit signed integers (on 64-bit systems) stored directly without heap allocation. Much faster than heap-allocated numbers.

### Speculation
V8's strategy of optimizing for observed types, then validating assumptions at runtime. If assumptions break, V8 deopts.

### TurboFan
V8's top-tier optimizing compiler. Generates highly optimized machine code with heavy analysis and inlining. Highest throughput but most expensive to compile, so many hot functions now stay on Maglev unless they prove ultra hot and stable.

### Type Feedback
Runtime information V8 collects about the types and values flowing through code. Used to guide speculative optimization.

## Object & Array Internals

### Dictionary Mode
Fallback storage mode for objects when they become too dynamic (many properties added/deleted). Uses hash table instead of hidden class. Slower property access.

### Fast Properties
Objects stored with hidden classes and predictable offsets. Fast property access.

### Slow Properties
Objects in dictionary mode. Property access requires hash table lookup.

### Transition Tree
V8's internal structure tracking how hidden classes evolve as properties are added. Enables sharing of hidden classes across objects with the same shape evolution.

### Holes (in arrays)
Missing elements in sparse arrays (e.g., `[1, , 3]`). Trigger checks on every access. Degrade performance.

### Packed Array
Array with no holes. Can skip hole checks, enabling optimization.

### Holey Array
Array with holes. Must check for holes on access. Slower than packed.

---

## Optimization States

### Ignition (Interpreter)
Entry tier. Executes bytecode, gathers feedback, and kicks off Sparkplug batches.

### Sparkplug Baseline Code
First native tier. Fast to compile, minimal optimization. Most functions run here unless they stay hot.

### Maglev Code
Mid-tier optimized code. Requires additional hotness; can OSR up to TurboFan or down to Sparkplug if assumptions break.

### TurboFan Code
Top-tier optimized code. Highest throughput but expensive to compile; V8 only promotes the hottest, most stable functions here.

### Deoptimized
V8 discarded optimized code (Maglev or TurboFan) and resumed execution in Sparkplug or Ignition, depending on availability.

### Optimization Disabled
Function has been deoptimized too many times or uses unsupported constructs; V8 stops trying to tier it up.

---

## Performance Metrics

### Allocation Rate
Bytes allocated per second. High allocation rate → frequent GC → throughput/latency degradation.

### Event Loop Lag
Difference between expected and actual time for event loop iteration. Indicates blocking operations.

### GC Pause Time
Duration the garbage collector stops execution to reclaim memory. Affects latency.

### Throughput
Operations per second. Often measured as requests/second for servers.

### Latency
Time to complete a single operation. P50, P95, P99 are common percentiles.

---

## V8 Flags (Selection)

### `--trace-opt`
Logs when functions are optimized by TurboFan.

### `--trace-deopt`
Logs deoptimizations with reasons.

### `--trace-ic`
Logs inline cache state transitions.

### `--cpu-prof`
Generates CPU profile (Chrome DevTools format).

### `--trace-gc`
Logs garbage collection activity.

### `--allow-natives-syntax`
Enables V8 intrinsic functions (e.g., `%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall()`). **Experimental only**, not for production.

### `--print-opt-code`
Prints generated machine code. Very verbose.

---

## Node.js Specific

### Back-Pressure
Flow control mechanism in streams. When a writable stream can't handle more data, it signals the readable stream to pause.

### Event Loop
Node.js's main execution loop. Processes callbacks from various phases (timers, I/O, immediate, close).

### Microtask Queue
Queue for `Promise` resolution callbacks. Processed between event loop phases.

### Worker Threads
Node.js threads for offloading CPU-intensive work. Separate V8 isolate per thread.

### Buffer
Node.js's binary data type. Wrapper around V8's `ArrayBuffer`. Optimized for I/O.

### TypedArray
JavaScript's typed arrays (`Uint8Array`, `Float64Array`, etc.). Efficient for numeric computation.

---

## Common Deopt Reasons

### "Insufficient type feedback"
Not enough data collected. Function called too few times before optimization attempt.

### "Wrong map"
Object shape changed. Hidden class mismatch.

### "Not a Smi"
Expected small integer, got float or heap number.

### "Not a heap number"
Type mismatch on numeric operation.

### "DivisionByZero"
Division by zero check failed.

### "Overflow"
Integer overflow detected.

### "Prototype chain changed"
Prototype was modified after optimization.

### "Out of bounds"
Array access outside bounds.

---

## Optimization Patterns

### Monomorphization
Ensuring call sites see only one type. Enables monomorphic ICs.

### Shape Stability
Keeping object shapes consistent. Prevents hidden class transitions.

### Elements Kind Stability
Keeping arrays homogeneous. Prevents elements kind transitions.

### Boundary Normalization
Converting heterogeneous inputs to consistent shapes at system boundaries. Keeps hot paths monomorphic.

### Try-Catch Isolation
Moving try-catch to wrapper functions. Allows hot path to be fully optimized.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Megamorphic Call Site
Call site that sees many types. Always slow, no optimization possible.

### Shape Thrashing
Repeatedly changing object shapes. Causes frequent deopts.

### Allocation Churn
Creating many short-lived objects. Overwhelms GC.

### Event Loop Blocking
Long synchronous operations. Delays all I/O.

### Cargo Cult Optimization
Applying patterns without understanding or measurement. Wastes effort.

---

## Profiling Tools

Browser-based profiler. Can attach to Node.js via `--inspect`. Provides CPU profiles, heap snapshots, timeline.

### clinic.js
Node.js performance profiling suite. Includes:
- **Doctor**: Diagnoses event loop issues
- **Flame**: Flame graphs
- **Bubbleprof**: Async operations visualization

### 0x
Flame graph profiler specifically for Node.js.

### `--cpu-prof`
Node.js's built-in CPU profiler. Generates `.cpuprofile` files.

### `--prof` / `--prof-process`
V8's statistical profiler. More low-level than `--cpu-prof`.
